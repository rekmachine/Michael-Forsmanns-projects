# Michael-Forsmanns-projects
Hey, I am Michael Forsmann I have a master's in biophysics and this is my spare time project.\
For my first project, I will be using which plant species countries has to predict which countries lay next to each other.\
I will do this in two ways first I will use Pearson correlation the linear correlation and after this,
I will use regression trees to estimate the non-linear correlation.
